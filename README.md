🎗️ Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the likelihood of breast cancer using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The system features a Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to input cell details and receive real-time predictions.

🚀 Features

📊 Dataset: Utilizes the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, which contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

🤖 Model: Trained an SVM model with an RBF kernel to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

🖥️ GUI: Built a user-friendly interface using Tkinter for seamless interaction.

⚡ Real-Time Prediction: Users can input cell details (e.g., clump thickness, uniform cell size) and get instant predictions.

🛠️ How It Works

🧹 Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, standardized, and split into training and testing sets.

🎓 Model Training: An SVM model is trained on the preprocessed data to classify tumors.

🖱️ GUI Application: The Tkinter app takes user input, processes it, and uses the trained model to make predictions.

📋 Result Display: Predictions are displayed in the GUI, indicating whether the tumor is likely malignant or benign.

🛠️ Technologies Used

🐍 Python Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Tkinter, Pickle

🎨 Frontend: Tkinter for the graphical user interface


🔮 Future Enhancements

1. Integrate more advanced models like Random Forest or Neural Networks.
   
2. Add 📊 data visualization to help users understand the prediction process.

3. Improve the GUI with additional features like 📜 history tracking or 📤 exporting results.

4. Package the application into an 📦 executable file for easier distribution.
