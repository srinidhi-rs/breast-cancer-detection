Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the likelihood of breast cancer using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The system features a Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to input cell details and receive real-time predictions.

Features

Dataset: Utilizes the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, which contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

Model: Trained an SVM model with an RBF kernel to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

GUI: Built a user-friendly interface using Tkinter for seamless interaction.

Real-Time Prediction: Users can input cell details (e.g., clump thickness, uniform cell size) and get instant predictions.

How It Works
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, standardized, and split into training and testing sets.

Model Training: An SVM model is trained on the preprocessed data to classify tumors.

GUI Application: The Tkinter app takes user input, processes it, and uses the trained model to make predictions.

Result Display: Predictions are displayed in the GUI, indicating whether the tumor is likely malignant or benign.

Technologies Used
Python Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Tkinter, Pickle

Frontend: Tkinter for the graphical user interface

How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-detection.git
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy
python app.py
The Tkinter GUI will launch, allowing you to input cell details and view predictions.

Future Enhancements
Integrate more advanced models like Random Forest or Neural Networks.

Add data visualization to help users understand the prediction process.

Improve the GUI with additional features like history tracking or exporting results.

Package the application into an executable file for easier distribution.
